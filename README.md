# Texture Direction Recognition
Detection of texture directions in arc minute accuracy for ground surfaces using Convolutional neural network

Steps:
- Create data for training
- Train the data using this model and save the file

Optional for validation steps:
- Create new test data
- Validate the result with the stored model
